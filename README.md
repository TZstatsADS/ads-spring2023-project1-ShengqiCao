### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: An Overview and Analysis to the Philosophy Development History
+ This project is conducted by Shengqi Cao

+ Project summary: In this project, from the data mining and data analysis step, we find some interesting discoveries. First, we have an overview of the development of philosophy history. Then, I picked up feminism to find the key author in its development. Finally, I used word cloud to analyze Wollstonecraft and Beauvoir's topic. It tells us Wollstonecraft more concentrated on the female right but Beauvoir focused on the relationship between men and women.
